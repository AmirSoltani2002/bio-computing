The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is a classic optimization problem in logistics and transportation, where a fleet of vehicles with limited capacity must deliver goods to a set of customers from a central depot. The goal is to determine the optimal set of routes for the vehicles that minimizes the total travel cost (e.g., distance or time) while ensuring that each customer's demand is fully met and that no vehicle exceeds its capacity. CVRP is a combinatorial problem and belongs to the NP-hard class, making it computationally challenging to solve for large instances. It has widespread applications in supply chain management, delivery services, and distribution planning.

In this project, I have studied a related paper (in article directory) and implemented its method, which is a Simulated Anbealing, to solve the CVRP problem. Moreover, I have solved this problem using an Immune System algorithm. In the end, I have compared these two results.
